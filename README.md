### ‚ú® Key Features

Terminus Dominus is not just another DDoS script. It's a sophisticated framework that simulates a multi-phased cyber-attack.

*   **üõ°Ô∏è Advanced WAF/JS Challenge Bypassing:** Utilizes a real browser engine (`Playwright`) to solve complex JavaScript challenges (like Cloudflare's "I'm Under Attack Mode"), harvesting valid session cookies to make subsequent attacks appear legitimate.
*   **üó∫Ô∏è Autonomous Attack Surface Mapping:** The `recon_and_destroy` strategy deploys a recursive crawler to map the entire target website, discovering all possible attack vectors (pages, forms, APIs) instead of just hitting the homepage.
*   **üí£ Multi-Vector Attack Capabilities:** Equipped with a diverse arsenal of "warheads":
    *   **HTTP Flood:** A classic, high-volume GET/POST request flood with randomized, realistic payloads.
    *   **Slow Read (Slowloris-like):** Exhausts the target's connection pool by keeping connections open and reading responses at an extremely slow pace.
    *   **HTTP/2 Stream Exhaustion:** Simulates the highly effective **HTTP/2 Rapid Reset** vulnerability (CVE-2023-44487), overwhelming modern servers by rapidly opening and canceling streams.
*   **üß† Intelligent Assault Strategies:** Move beyond simple attacks with dynamic strategies that mix and match warheads against all discovered targets, making the attack pattern unpredictable and harder to mitigate.
*   **üï∂Ô∏è Hyper-Realistic Evasion:** Generates highly realistic HTTP headers, user agents, referers, and even spoofs source IPs in headers like `X-Forwarded-For` to mimic real user traffic.
*   **üíª Live C2-Style Battlefield Reporting:** A clean and professional Command & Control (C2) panel provides a real-time report of the operation, including RPS, data transmitted, success/fail codes, and perimeter breach status.

### üöÄ Getting Started

#### 1. Prerequisites

You need Python 3.8+ and the `pip` package manager.

#### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/terminus-dominus.git
    cd terminus-dominus
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If `requirements.txt` does not exist, create it with the following content:
    ```txt
    httpx[http2]
    rich
    playwright
    beautifulsoup4
    lxml
    ```

3.  **Install Playwright browsers:**
    This is a one-time setup that downloads the necessary browser binaries.
    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```

### ‚öîÔ∏è Usage

The framework is controlled via command-line arguments.

```
usage: terminus_dominus.py [-h] -c CONCURRENCY -m {flood,slow_read,stream_exhaust,dynamic_breach,recon_and_destroy} [-p PROXIES] [-d DEPTH] [--visible-bypass] url
```

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# THE ULTIMATE ATTACK: Breach, recon, and destroy an entire site with 250 legionnaires using proxies.
python terminus_dominus.py https://example.com -c 250 -m recon_and_destroy -p proxies.txt

# Focused HTTP/2 exhaustion attack against a specific API endpoint after solving the main site's challenge.
python terminus_dominus.py https://api.example.com/v1/data -c 150 -m stream_exhaust

# See the challenge bypass in action (non-headless mode).
python terminus_dominus.py https://example.com -c 50 -m dynamic_breach --visible-bypass
```
